# Image Generation with Pre-trained Models (Google Colab)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates image generation using a pre-trained generative AI model. The implementation is done on **Google Colab** to efficiently handle large model sizes and GPU requirements. The Stable Diffusion model is used to generate high-quality images from text prompts without training a model from scratch.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To generate realistic images from textual descriptions using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model in a cloud-based environment.

---

## 🧠 Model Used
- **Stable Diffusion v1.5**
- Pre-trained on large-scale image-text datasets

---

## 🛠 Platform & Tools
- Google Colab (GPU enabled)
